# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
### The goat of this project is to find relevant insights and relationships within certain tables utilizing 
### SQL queries in order to solve the given questions.

## Process
### 1. I wrote queries to scourge through the dataset and find interesting relationships within the data, that
### would be relevant to solve the target questions. I would also take note of missing data, and deal with null
### values when conducting the queries to solve the questions.
### 2. After writing those initial queries, I would then write queries to filter and aggregate data that would
### solve the questions at hand, taking note of imbalances found in the dataset during exploration and dealing
### with those rough spots.

## Results

This data held relevant information pertaining towards google products, and held a variety of information concerning
their prices, locations of purchases and overall sentiment of the customers. Using this dataset, I was able
to gain insight on what certain demographics liked to purchase and how impactful demographics were in actively
generating revenue for this company. I was also able to see how these demographics felt about the products they bought
and how strongly they held these opinions.
## Challenges 

Some of the challenges I faced included navigating the datasets, finding relevant columns, and dealing with 
null values. Some of the datasets have hundreds of thousands of rows so figuring out queries to help navigate
what was relevant was a task. Handling null values 
## Future Goals

I'd look more into the products table, as I didn't take much of a look at the ordered_quantity or stock_level columns.
I would also look more at relationships that the social_engagement_type and channel_grouping columns have with the rest of the data_set.
